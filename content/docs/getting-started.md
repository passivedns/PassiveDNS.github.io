# What is PassiveDNS ?

The passive DNS application will allow you to track your domain names. You will have the possibility to follow the evolution of IPs and information relating to them (such as for example: geographic address, IPV5 or IPV6 address ...).

You can also link some externs apis such as VirusTotal and AlienVault to retrieve the history of domain names and IPs.

If a change is noticed by our application you will be notified by mail, or using redis, GCP or AWS pub/sub.

You can also supervise your users thanks to a user creation authorization system.

Follow this guide to learn how to install and use this app, and enjoy!
