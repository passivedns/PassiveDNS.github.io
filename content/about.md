The passive DNS allows you to monitore specific domain names. This application checks for you if the resolution of domains changed, at some point. Alerts are sent in order to keep you in touch. 

## Why would you monitore domain names ?

There are multiple reasons as to why this app is useful.

The first case is if you want to monitore the domain names that you own. This would allow you to be alerted if some malicious attacker tried to change it.
This kind of attack is called DNS hijacking or [DNS spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing).

The second case is if you want to monitore some attackers domain name, that were made public from reports. This way, you can be alerted if they change ip or domains, meaning that they plan on doing something.
